## Portola August 2023
We reserved Portola Redwoods SP 031, for Thursday night, Aug 3, 2023.

Our campsite was #31, and it was perfect -- fairly private, large, full of redwoods, near a stream.

The next day we did a 5.3 mile hike from the campground area.  The redwoods there, and the beauty of the hiking trails, was among the best.

We hiked Iverson trail, to Tiptoe falls, and up Summit trail.  We did about 500 vertical feet.  The weather was perfect.

## Mt Madonna September 2023

It's nearing the end of the season.  One night as Tan Oak.  site #409.  Me and Catherine.

I'm in my one person tent, Cath in her RV.  We have enough firewood.  We strung up lights.

Dinner didn't get going until after dark. This site was ok, a motorcycle neighbor nearby.

It rained lightly all night.  Kind of wrecked anything in cardboard that we left out.  All my extra clothes got al little damp.  Fun.
