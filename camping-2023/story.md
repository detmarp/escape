## Portola August 2023
We reserved Portola Redwoods SP 031, for Thursday night, Aug 3, 2023.

Our campsite was #31, and it was perfect -- fairly private, large, full of redwoods, near a stream.

The next day we did a 5.3 mile hike from the campground area.  The redwoods there, and the beauty of the hiking trails, was among the best.

We hiked Iverson trail, to Tiptoe falls, and up Summit trail.  We did about 500 vertical feet.  The weather was perfect.
